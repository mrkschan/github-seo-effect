github-seo-effect
=================

This is a repository to tryout the seo effect of github.

Hypothesis:
Google would give github repo pretty high ranking. ~~If a repo's README has a link to a page outside github, that page gets SEO bonus.~~ edit: 20130308  If a repo's homepage has set to a web page, that page would get SEO bonus from Google (I didn't carry out experiment on the effect of the README yet). And, if the page links back to the github repo, that's a plus.

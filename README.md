github-seo-effect
=================

This is a repository to tryout the seo effect of github.

Hypothesis:
Google would give github repo pretty high ranking. If a repo's README has a link to a page outside github, that page gets SEO bonus. And, if the page links back to the github repo, that's a plus.
